### What is Re-ranking?
Re-ranking is the process of reordering a set of documents retrieved during the initial retrieval phase. The goal is to prioritize the most relevant documents for the query, ensuring that the language model has access to the best possible context for generating accurate and meaningful responses.

### Why is Re-ranking Important in RAG?
1. **Improves Relevance**: Initial retrieval methods (like dense vector search or BM25) may not always surface the most relevant documents at the top. Re-ranking refines this by applying more sophisticated relevance judgments.
2. **Enhances Generation Quality**: By providing the language model with higher-quality documents, re-ranking ensures that the generated responses are more accurate and contextually appropriate.
3. **Balances Efficiency and Effectiveness**: While initial retrieval is fast and scalable, re-ranking focuses on a smaller subset of documents, allowing for more computationally intensive relevance assessments.

### How Does Re-ranking Work?
1. **Initial Retrieval**: A fast method (e.g., dense embeddings or keyword-based search) retrieves a broad set of candidate documents.
2. **Re-ranking Phase**:
   - A more advanced model (e.g., cross-encoder or neural re-ranker) evaluates the relevance of each document to the query.
   - The documents are then reordered based on their relevance scores.
3. **Final Selection**: The top-ranked documents are passed to the language model for response generation.

### Techniques for Re-ranking
- **Cross-Encoders**: These models use deep semantic understanding by jointly encoding the query and document, allowing for fine-grained relevance judgments.
- **Learning-to-Rank Models**: These are trained on labeled data to predict the relevance of documents.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine traditional methods (like BM25) with neural models for a balance of speed and accuracy.

### Example in Practice
Imagine a RAG system retrieving documents about "climate change." The initial retrieval might return documents on "global warming," "carbon emissions," and "renewable energy." Re-ranking ensures that the most directly relevant documents (e.g., those specifically addressing "climate change") are prioritized for the language model.

## MMMR

Maximal Marginal Relevance (**MMR**) plays a crucial role in **RAG** by improving the selection of retrieved documents before passing them to the language model. The goal is to **balance relevance and diversity**, ensuring that retrieved documents are not only highly relevant to the query but also provide unique perspectives.

### **Why MMR Matters in RAG**
In standard RAG pipelines, retrieval models often return the **top-k most relevant documents** based on similarity scores. However, these documents can be **redundant**, meaning they contain overlapping information rather than diverse insights. MMR helps mitigate this issue by:
- **Reducing redundancy** in retrieved documents.
- **Ensuring diverse perspectives** are included in the context.
- **Improving response quality** by providing a richer knowledge base for the LLM.

### **How MMR Works in RAG**
MMR re-ranks retrieved documents using the formula:

MHere’s the formula expressed in a **markdown-friendly and reader-friendly format**:

```
MMR(Dᵢ) = λ × Relevance(Dᵢ, Q) - (1 - λ) × max(Similarity(Dᵢ, Dⱼ))
```

Where:
- **MMR(Dᵢ):** The score of the document \( Dᵢ \).
- **λ:** A balancing factor between relevance and diversity.
- **Relevance(Dᵢ, Q):** How well document \( Dᵢ \) matches the query \( Q \).
- **Similarity(Dᵢ, Dⱼ):** How similar \( Dᵢ \) is to already-selected documents \( Dⱼ \).

- **λ (lambda)** controls the trade-off between relevance and diversity:
  - **λ = 1** → Pure relevance (standard retrieval).
  - **λ = 0** → Maximum diversity (avoids redundancy).
  - **λ ∈ (0,1)** → Balances relevance and diversity.

### **MMR in Action: Example for Code Search RAG**
Imagine you’re building a **code search RAG system**. A developer queries:
> "Where is the function `parse_config` defined?"

Without MMR, the retriever might return:
1. `config.py` (contains `parse_config`)
2. `config.py` (same file, slightly different chunk)
3. `settings.py` (mentions `parse_config` but lacks details)

With MMR, the system **prioritizes diversity**, selecting:
1. `config.py` (contains `parse_config`)
2. `settings.py` (mentions `parse_config` in a different context)
3. `utils.py` (references `parse_config` usage)

This ensures the LLM gets **a broader context**, leading to **better responses**.

### **MMR Implementation in LangChain**
If you're using **LangChain** for retrieval, you can enable MMR like this:
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Load vector store
vector_store = FAISS.load_local("faiss_index", OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Perform MMR-based retrieval
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_type="mmr", search_kwargs={"lambda_mult": 0.5, "k": 5})
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents("Where is parse_config defined?")

print([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
```

### **Key Benefits of MMR in RAG**
✅ **Improves retrieval quality** by selecting diverse documents.  
✅ **Reduces hallucinations** by ensuring responses are grounded in varied sources.  
✅ **Enhances multi-faceted answers**, especially for complex queries.
