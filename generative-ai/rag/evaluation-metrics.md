## RAG Evaluation Metrics

1. **Faithfulness**
    - Answers generated by the model stay true to the given context
    - Answers are consistent with the context information
2. **Answer Relevance**
    - Are generated answers related to the posed question?
    - Does the model provide pertinent information?
3. **Context Relevance**
    - Is retrieved contextual information accurate and relevant?
4. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**
    - Statistical metric that tells us how early in the retrieval list a useful document appears.
    - `MRR = (1 / N) * Î£ (1 / rank of first relevant result)`
    - Example: 
        - Top k rank = 5
        - Q1 -> [D1, D2, D3, D4, D5] (first_relevant = D2)
        - Q2 -> [D3, D1, D4, D8, D9] (first_relevant = D3)
        - Q3 -> [D7, D8, D9, D5, D6] (first_relevant = None)
        - `MRR = (1/2 + 1 + 0)/3 = 0.5`

### LLM As A Judge

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as evaluators or "judges" to assess the quality of generated outputs in various machine learning tasks. This approach leverages the inherent capabilities of LLMs to understand and evaluate language, enabling scalable and automated assessments. Below are some key aspects of using LLMs as judges:

1. **Applications of LLMs as Judges**:
    - **Answer Quality Evaluation**: LLMs can assess the faithfulness, relevance, and coherence of generated answers by comparing them to the provided context or ground truth.
    - **Scoring and Ranking**: LLMs can assign scores to generated outputs based on predefined criteria, such as informativeness or fluency, and rank them accordingly.
    - **Error Detection**: LLMs can identify inconsistencies, hallucinations, or irrelevant information in generated outputs.

2. **Advantages**:
    - **Scalability**: Automating the evaluation process reduces the reliance on human evaluators, making it feasible to assess large datasets or numerous outputs.
    - **Consistency**: LLMs provide consistent evaluations, avoiding the variability introduced by human subjectivity.
    - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces the cost and time associated with manual evaluation.

3. **Challenges**:
    - **Bias in Evaluation**: LLMs may inherit biases from their training data, which can affect their judgment.
    - **Lack of Ground Truth**: In some cases, the absence of a clear ground truth can make it difficult for LLMs to provide accurate evaluations.
    - **Overfitting to Metrics**: LLMs might optimize for specific evaluation metrics, potentially overlooking qualitative aspects of the output.

4. **Guidelines for Effective Use**:
    - **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune LLMs on domain-specific data to improve their evaluation capabilities.
    - **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully design prompts to guide the LLM in providing accurate and relevant judgments.
    - **Human Oversight**: Combine LLM evaluations with human oversight to mitigate biases and ensure reliability.
