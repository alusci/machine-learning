An **LLM-based agent** refers to an artificial intelligence system that is built on a **Large Language Model (LLM)**—a powerful AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These agents can process and produce coherent, context-aware responses, making them useful for various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated content creation tools.

Here’s how an LLM-based agent typically works:
- **Understanding Input**: It analyzes and interprets user queries using deep learning and natural language processing.
- **Generating Responses**: Based on learned patterns and context, it crafts replies that are relevant, engaging, and informative.
- **Adapting & Refining**: Some agents can refine their responses based on feedback, improving their accuracy and relevance over time.
