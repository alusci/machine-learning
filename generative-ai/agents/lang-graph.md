Certainly! Here's an introduction to **LangGraph**, a framework designed for building **multi-agent workflows** and **graph-based LLM applications** using LangChain.

## 🔷 What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is an extension of LangChain that introduces a **graph-based execution model**. It enables developers to build **stateful**, **multi-agent** LLM workflows as **directed graphs**—where each node represents a step (e.g., an agent or function), and each edge defines how control flows between them.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. **Nodes**
- Represent **functions**, **agents**, or **chains**.
- Can perform tasks such as:
  - Answering questions
  - Routing input
  - Invoking tools or other agents

### 2. **Edges**
- Define the **transitions** between nodes.
- Can be **static** (fixed flow) or **dynamic** (based on function output).
- Allow **conditional branching**, **looping**, and **multi-path execution**.

### 3. **Graph**
- A **LangGraph object** is a **directed graph** where:
  - You **add nodes**
  - Define how data flows between them using edges
  - Execute it with an input and maintain **state**

### 4. **Multi-Agent Workflows**
- Supports coordination among multiple agents.
- Agents can **communicate**, **delegate**, or **decide next steps**.
- Useful for advanced scenarios like:
  - AI assistants with roles (planner, executor, validator)
  - Document QA + summarization loops
  - Tool-using agents with retry mechanisms

## ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified Example)

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Define nodes (functions or chains)
def node_a(state): ...
def node_b(state): ...
def decide_next_node(state): return "node_a" or "node_b"

# Create a state graph
builder = StateGraph()

# Add nodes
builder.add_node("start", node_a)
builder.add_node("decision", decide_next_node)
builder.add_node("node_a", node_a)
builder.add_node("node_b", node_b)

# Define edges
builder.set_entry_point("start")
builder.add_edge("start", "decision")
builder.add_conditional_edges("decision", decide_next_node)

# Compile the graph
graph = builder.compile()

# Run
final_state = graph.invoke(initial_input)
```

## 🧩 When to Use LangGraph

- When you need **complex control flow** beyond LangChain's simple chains.
- To implement **multi-step reasoning**, **retrials**, or **parallel agents**.
- For **modular** and **interpretable** LLM orchestration.

## Prompt chaining

AI-generated outputs flow from one step to the next one, creating a multi structured  multi=step execution process. 

This allows for better modularization. For example, the first step generates a marketing copy. The the next steps (2, 3, 4) translates the copy to French, Spanish, and Chinese in parallel. 

## Orchestrator-Worker Model

1. Takes input from the user
2. Routes request to multiple LLMs
3. Synthetizes response

This is a very common system architecture

## Evaluator Optimizer Model

1. The evaluator assesses the performances of the LLM
2. The output is either accepted or rejected based on the evaluation score

## Patterns in LangGraph

- Augmented LLMs generate responses in set formats (for example JSON or CSV)
- This models interacts with tools, APIs, and databases to perform actions beyond text generation, such as calling services, running queries, and accessing real-time data. 

## LangGraph Agent

- Input -> LLM Call -> Action <-> Feedback <-> Tool -> Output
- LangGraph agents are AI agents that operate within a structured graph-based workflow, enabling 
controlled and modular execution of tasks.
