## 🌳 What is **Tree of Thoughts** (ToT) Prompting?

**Tree of Thoughts** prompting is inspired by **search algorithms** and **human problem-solving**:  
Instead of forcing the LLM to generate a full solution in one go, it explores **multiple partial solutions** (or "thoughts") across a **decision tree**, evaluates them, and proceeds **deliberately** down the most promising paths.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

### 1. **Thoughts = Partial Solutions**
Each “thought” is a candidate **intermediate step** toward solving the problem.
- These can be reasoning steps, code snippets, or logical deductions.
- Each branch in the tree is an **alternate way of thinking** about the next step.

### 2. **Tree Structure = Exploration**
You construct a **tree**, where:
- **Nodes** are intermediate reasoning states.
- **Branches** are alternate continuations.
- The model may generate multiple possible continuations at each node.

### 3. **Evaluation = Self-Critique**
At each level, the model can **evaluate** the candidate thoughts and choose:
- Which ones to expand (continue thinking).
- Which ones to discard (prune).
- Which path to follow toward a final solution.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Simplified)

### Step-by-step flow:
```text
1. Start with a problem: "What's the shortest path from A to Z with these constraints?"
2. Generate 2-3 possible first thoughts.
3. For each thought, generate 2-3 continuations (next-level thoughts).
4. At each level, evaluate or score each path (e.g., correctness, completeness, potential).
5. Keep expanding the most promising ones until you reach a full answer.
```

## 🔍 Example Use Case

**Problem**: “What's the smallest number divisible by 3, 5, and 7 that is greater than 100?”

**ToT Approach**:
- Step 1: Generate multiple ideas:
  - Thought A: Find LCM of 3, 5, 7 → 105
  - Thought B: Multiply pairs first → LCM(3,5)=15, then LCM(15,7)=105
  - Thought C: Brute-force loop from 101 upward

- Step 2: Evaluate which thought is correct and efficient → pick A or B

- Step 3: Conclude: Answer = 105

## 🧪 Benefits

| Benefit                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧭 **Better planning**       | Forces the model to *pause*, think, and evaluate at each stage              |
| 🌿 **Exploration**           | Surfaces multiple solutions instead of committing to the first thought     |
| 🧠 **Self-correction**       | By comparing branches, model can discard bad paths and fix errors           |
| 📈 **Improved performance**  | Empirically outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) on some math and logic tasks |

## 🧱 Building Blocks (in code or practice)

If you're implementing this in LangChain or Python:
- Use loops or search over prompt completions
- Keep a **tree data structure** (or even a queue)
- Add **scoring** functions (could be another LLM pass)
- Optionally, use **beam search**, **breadth-first**, or **depth-limited** expansions

## 🆚 CoT vs ToT

| Feature                  | Chain of Thought (CoT)         | Tree of Thoughts (ToT)          |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Path                     | Linear                        | Branching                        |
| Number of thoughts       | 1 (per inference)             | Multiple per level               |
| Evaluation               | Optional                      | Central to the process           |
| Goal                     | Single path reasoning         | Explore + evaluate + reason      |

## 🧪 Real-World Applications

- Complex math/logic puzzles
- Code synthesis or debugging
- Strategy games or planning tasks (e.g., Sudoku, Tower of Hanoi)
- Autonomous agents that need to reason over future states
