# üîç PyTorch vs TensorFlow: Main Differences

| Feature                     | **PyTorch**                                      | **TensorFlow**                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Development Style**      | Dynamic computation graph (**eager execution**)  | Static computation graph by default (TF1),<br>eager execution enabled in TF2 |
| **Ease of Use**            | Pythonic and intuitive, especially for research  | Steeper learning curve, more boilerplate         |
| **Debugging**              | Easy with native Python tools (e.g., `pdb`)      | More complex in static graph mode                |
| **Model Deployment**       | TorchScript, ONNX, or via Python                 | TensorFlow Serving, TF Lite, TF.js, TF Hub       |
| **Mobile & Edge**          | Limited support via Torch Mobile                 | Strong support: TF Lite, Coral, EdgeTPU          |
| **Visualization**          | Basic support (`torch.utils.tensorboard`)        | Rich native support with **TensorBoard**         |
| **API Consistency**        | Cleaner and more consistent in most cases        | APIs evolved over time; TF2 is more unified      |
| **Community**              | Strong in **research/academia**                  | Strong in **industry/production**                |
| **Keras Integration**      | No official equivalent (but has `torch.nn`)      | Official high-level API via **Keras**            |
| **Performance Optimization** | Manual tuning often needed                     | XLA compiler, Graph optimizations, AutoGraph     |

## üß† Summary for Interviews

- **PyTorch** is often preferred by researchers and for prototyping because of its **eager execution**, intuitive API, and tight integration with Python.
- **TensorFlow** is often preferred in production environments for its **robust deployment tools**, support for **mobile/edge devices**, and strong **ecosystem**.

## üõ†Ô∏è When to Use What?

- Choose **PyTorch** if:
  - You're building new models quickly.
  - You want full flexibility and easier debugging.
  - You work in a research-oriented environment.

- Choose **TensorFlow** if:
  - You need to deploy at scale (e.g., on mobile, server, web).
  - You rely on pre-built production tools (TF Serving, TF Lite).
  - You prefer a high-level API like **Keras**.
