# 📚 LSTM vs Transformer: Key Differences

## 🔧 Architectural Overview

| Feature                     | LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)                        | Transformer                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture Type**      | Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)                      | Attention-based (non-recurrent)                 |
| **Processing Style**       | Sequential (one token at a time)                    | Parallel (entire sequence at once)              |
| **Dependency Modeling**    | Local context with limited long-term memory         | Captures global dependencies via self-attention |
| **Memory Mechanism**       | Cell state + input/forget/output gates              | Attention weights over all tokens               |
| **Parallelization**        | Difficult due to step-by-step recurrence            | Highly parallelizable                           |
| **Training Speed**         | Slower due to sequential processing                 | Much faster with GPU acceleration               |
| **Scalability**            | Limited by sequence length and computation cost     | Scales well to large datasets and long texts    |
| **Use Cases (historically)** | Language modeling, time series, speech recognition | NLP, computer vision, audio, multi-modal tasks  |

## 🧠 Summary for Interviews

> “LSTMs process sequences one token at a time using memory cells and gating mechanisms, which makes them good for short- to mid-range dependencies but slow to train. Transformers instead use self-attention to relate all positions in the input simultaneously, allowing them to model long-range dependencies more effectively and in parallel — which is why they dominate in modern NLP and beyond.”
